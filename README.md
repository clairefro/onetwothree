A demo app for Postman workshop.

### WARNING!!!!

This was very lazily built with mega insecure auth - including storing raw password strings in database ðŸ™ƒ.

You probably can't find out how to get into my mongo db, but if you are a crazy hacker, be sure to use an arbitrary password that in no way relates to a password you'd use in real life.

### Note to future-self

Forgot where you db is? Try Mongo Atlas
